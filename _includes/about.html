      <p>I am a fourth year Creative Media and Game Technologies student at Breda University of Applied Sciences. 
        I have a passion for the technical aspects associated with the creation of games. 
        This includes making features for said games and anything adjacent to make the game functional.
        I would say that my specialties are working on features with which the player interacts with directly, and technical gameplay features â€” such as making plants grow out of the ground, grapple hooks, etc.
        I have a lot of experience working in interdisciplinary teams which has given me a lot of insight into the creative avenues of game development as well.
