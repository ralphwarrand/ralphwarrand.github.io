      <p>I am a Creative Media and Game Technologies graduate from Breda University of Applied Sciences. 
        I have a passion for the technical aspects associated with the creation of games. 
        This includes making features for said games and anything adjacent to make the game functional.
        I would say that my specialties are working on features with which the player interacts with directly, and technical gameplay features â€” such as making plants grow out of the ground, grapple hooks, or anything the design team dreams up.
        During my degree I gained a lot of experience working in interdisciplinary teams. In two of my longest projects I served as Technical Lead which taught me a great deal about managing development and working in a larger team. 
        This experience has given me a lot of insight into the creative avenues of game development as well. I often give my opinion about the direction of the project as well as pointing out potential pitfalls.

      <p>Currently I am pursuing a Pre-Master in Computer Science and Engineering at TU/e. My primary goal is to develop my theoretical understanding of computation, so that I can become a better software developer.
