description: This project was made during second quarter of the second year at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I primarily worked on gameplay programming and also some minor graphics programming. During this project I prototyped plants growing when the player gets close to them, as well as the behaviour of the enemy flowers. This was the first time I worked with 3D animations with games, and I managed to incorporate it well into the enemy behaviour.

    text: "I worked together with artists to control the animation so that the flower would target the player if they entered a certain range. The light inside the flower is programmatically implemented so that artists can change the settings. The light shines through because of subsurface scattering. This was the first time I worked with enemy behaviour before, so I had some struggles initially, but by testing out the capabilities of Unreal Engine, I discovered how to make it work as designers intended."

    text: "I worked on a gameplay system that would allow the player to transform the cursed environment into a flourishing environment. We took inspiration from Kena, for this aspect of the game. I used shader techniques to make the flowers grow and dynamically change colours. I also implemented the gameplay camera transition to give the player a clear view of what is happening. I also added the growing ring to indicate the borders of the transformation and to give it more visual flair."
